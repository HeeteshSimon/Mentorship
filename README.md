## Data Analytics
User Behavior Analytics or UBA focuses on what the user is doing: apps
launched, network activity, and, most critically, files accessed (when the file or
email was touched, who touched it, what was done with it and how frequently). <br>
UBA technology searches for patterns of usage that indicate unusual or
anomalous behavior — regardless of whether the activities are coming from a
hacker, insider, or even malware or other processes. While UBA won’t prevent
hackers or insiders from getting into your system, it can quickly spot their work
and minimize damage.<br>
I have integrated my website to an analytics platform named Google Analytics.
This tool is able to track the users action and the time spent by the users on the
various actions of the website. I have accumulated the analytics data from
various users and stored it.<br>
I have collected data of around 102 users with various data points such as: <br>
● Time spent by users on the different pages on website,<br>
● Filters being used by the users , <br>
● Time spent by users on a particular product page, etc.
